This "Project" is used to read / convert the data from an AquaDiveLog database.
Currently only the "Export to UDDF" is under development, but other options might follow.

Reason for this is me switching from the Palm-based ADL to another Scubadiving logbook supporting the import of UDDF.

In the pipeline:
- Export to PDL = PHP DiveLog, a WebBased Diving Logbook.
